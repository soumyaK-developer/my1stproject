    <h1>This is a sister-cooking website.</h1>
    <p>And it's cooking perfect.</p>
    <h2>Seriously, what the cook else do you want?</h2>
    <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some cooking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, sister-cooker. Let me describe your perfect website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The sister-cooker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's legible and gets your cooking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Well guess what, sister-cooker:</h3>
    <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a sister-cooking website. Why the cook do you need to animate a cooking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your cooking site, and some sister-cooker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
    <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
    <h2>It's cooking lightweight</h2>
    <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your cooking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the cooking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
    <h2>It's responsive</h2>
    <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever sister-cooking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a sister-cooking Tamagotchi.</p>
    <h2>It cooking works</h2>
    <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, sister-cooker. It makes sense. It has sister-cooking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch browser know what the cook's in this cooking site. That's semantics, sister-cooker.</p>
    <p>It has content on the cooking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
    <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this sister-cooker in IE6. I cooking dare you.</p>
    <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
    <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no cooking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a cooking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's cooking beautiful.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is cooking satire, you cook</h3>
    <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <b>ones we create ourselves</b>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch</p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es/">txti</a> was created. You should try it today to make your own sister-cooking websites.</p>
